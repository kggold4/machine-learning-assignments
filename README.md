### <i>This assignment has two main parts:</i>

> Part 1 - Implement Perceptron:

For this question see the notebook: [perceptron.ipynb](perceptron.ipynb).

By given the [two_circles](data/two_circles.txt) of 150 points, we built a perceptron model that classified this data into two different group:

> Part 2 - Implement AdaBoost Algorithm:

For this question see the notebook: [adaboost.ipynb](adaboost.ipynb)

By given the [two_circles](data/four_circles.txt) of 150 points, we built an adaboost model that classified this data into four different group:
