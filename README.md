### <i>This assignment has two main parts:</i>

> Part 1 - Implement Perceptron:

For this question see the notebook: [perceptron.ipynb](perceptron.ipynb).

By given the [two_circles](https://github.com/kggold4/machine-learning-ex3/blob/main/data/two_circle.txt) of 150 points, we built a ```perceptron``` model that classified this data into two different group:

> Part 2 - Implement AdaBoost Algorithm:

For this question see the notebook: [adaboost.ipynb](adaboost.ipynb).

By given the [four_circle](https://github.com/kggold4/machine-learning-ex3/blob/main/data/four_circle.txt) of 150 points, we built an ```adaboost``` model that classified this data into four different group:
